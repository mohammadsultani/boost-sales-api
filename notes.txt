The program will fetch yesterday sales by default. 
Additional dates can be added too eg: 2025-12-25 or if range, 2025-12-10,2025-12-20

The last run date is stored in the settings file. If the last run date is not yesterday, the program will fetch any missing data starting from the last run date or from 30 days ago, whichever is more recent.

The exe is built with node v18.16.0, axios version is 0.21.4, Only this version of axios is working well with pkg

An API sandbox environment is insomnia.
An email chain can be used for reference too.


Notes about the data:

- Quantity = Gross Amount / Gross Price
  (This gives the number of items sold.)

- Transaction count is **not** the same as quantity.

- Gross Price and Price are the same.

- GST is the total tax for the entire row (includes quantity).

- Gross Price = price per unit **including** tax.

- Net Price = price per unit **excluding** tax.

- Gross Amount = total paid for the item (quantity × unit price including tax).

- Net Amount = total paid excluding tax (quantity × net price).

- Amount and Net Amount are the same.

- To get the total bill, use the Gross Amount

- Discount of the bill will be a line item with CategoryName = POS Discounts


There are two APIs which we can use to get sales data:

First one is sales by item which has the details of the item sold. 
This API has no payment type details.

The other one is sales media.
This API gives total sales for an outlet for a specific date.
The total sales is broken down by payment type. But it is a total figure for the day eg: Cash: 2000.


Sales Media type API: https://boostthailand.redcatcloud.com.au/api/private/reports/kpi/salesmedia  (not included in the online docs)
